            MiniJava+ Lexical and Syntax Forms

NOTE (Feb. 16): This is a slight revision of the document used in Project 1.
There are two changes. The first one concerns nonterminal Type and a related
new nonterminal PrimeType. The second concerns nonterminal Object. See Project 2
handout for more detials.

MiniJava+ is a subset of Java. The meaning of a MiniJava+ program is given 
by its meaning as a Java program. Overloading is not allowed in MiniJava+. 
The MiniJava+ statement System.out.println( …); can only print integers and 
string constants. We do not have string variables.
The MiniJava+ expression e.length only applies to expressions that are arrays.

*********************
* TOKEN DEFINITIONS *
*********************

Identifiers: An identifier is a sequence of letters, digits, and underscores,
starting with a letter. Uppercase letters are distinguished from lowercase. 
In this specification, the symbol id stands for an identifier.

Integer literals: A sequence of decimal digits is an integer constant 
that denotes the corresponding integer value. Leading zeros are allowed.

In this specification the symbol INTEGER_LITERAL stands for an integer 
constant and the symbol STRING_LITERAL stands for a quoted string, e.g.
 "hello world".

Binary operators: A binary operator is one of

&& || < >  <= >= == != + - * /

In this specification the symbol op stands for a binary operator.

We treat ++ as a single token, even though this token does not appear in any production rules. This is to avoid a different semantic meaning of ++ than in Java, while we still allow a unary + operator and a binary + operator. Expression a + + b then is equivalent to a+b, but a ++ b will violate the syntax rule in MiniJava+.

Comments: A comment may appear between any two tokens. There are two forms 
of comments: One starts with /*, ends with */, with no other */ in between;
another begins with // and goes to the end of the line.

****************
* SYNTAX FORMS *
****************

NOTE 1: The notation N*, where N is a nonterminal, means
 0, 1, or more repetitions of N.

NOTE 2: Not all programs that satisfy the following syntax forms are
actually valid programs, but the type checking step of the compiler will
identify such invalid programs.

NOTE 3: In the production rules, the symbol “:” means “derives”. We avoid using “->” in case it may be confused with operators in the right-hand side. ":" followed by a blank right-hand side indicates an empty rule.

NOTE 4: Semantic meaning of the program constructs formed by the production rules follow that in Java. Some explanations will be given in Project 2 to enhance the understanding. In this project, please try deriving statements using the production rules and see what they look like.

NOTE 5: A short sample program is appended. Further samples may be posted as needed.
